                            <p class="accordion">Is bleed available for free and public use?</p>
                            <div class="panel">No. You must purchase either a <b>monthly</b> or <b>onetime</b> subscription for <i>bleed</i> to be invited to your server.</div>
                            
                            <p class="accordion">How can I pay for bleed?</p>
                            <div class="panel"><i>bleed</i> costs <b>USD$10</b> <u>per month</u> to operate. You are also able to make a <u>one-time payment</u> of <b>USD$30</b>. These prices are <u>final</u> and not subject for negotiation. You can pay using the following payment methods: <b>PayPal (friends & family), Venmo, Cashapp, Bitcoin, Ethereum</b>. Note that <b>refunds will never be processed</b>.</div>
       
                            <p class="accordion">What happens if I do not want to continue paying monthly?</p>
                            <div class="panel">If you do not wish to pay monthly anymore, feel free to <u>leave a message</u> to <b><a href="https://jace.lol/discord" target="_blank">jace#0819</a></b> via <b>Discord</b> expressing that you would like to modify your subscription. This will prevent reoccurring messages reminding you to pay your monthly subscription fee again.</div>

                            <p class="accordion">What happens if I lose bleed?</p>
                            <div class="panel">If something occurs that causes you to lose <i>bleed</i>, feel free to <u>leave a message</u> to <b><a href="https://jace.lol/discord" target="_blank">jace#0819</a></b> via <b>Discord</b> expressing that you would like it back in your server. Ensure to <u>attach proof of payment</u> in your message. If you lose <i>bleed</i> <u>more than once</u>, your previous subscription (monthly/onetime) will be <u>voided</u>, thus requiring you to begin a new subscription.</div>

                            <p class="accordion">What happens if I want to transfer bleed to another server?</p>
                            <div class="panel">If you want to transfer <i>bleed</i> to another server, feel free to <u>leave a message</u> to <b><a href="https://jace.lol/discord" target="_blank">jace#0819</a></b> via <b>Discord</b> expressing that you would like to transfer the bot to another server. Ensure to <u>attach proof of payment</u>, the server ID to the server that <i>bleed</i> is currently in, and a server ID to the server that you want <i>bleed</i> to be transferred to in your message. If you want <i>bleed</i> to be transferred <u>more than once</u>, your previous subscription (monthly/onetime) will be <u>voided</u>, thus requiring you to begin a new subscription.</div>

                            <p class="accordion">What do I do after I pay?</p>
                            <div class="panel">After purchasing <i>bleed</i>, invite the bot by going to <a href="https://jace.lol/invite" target="_blank">https://jace.lol/invite</a>, selecting the server you paid for from the dropdown menu, selecting <b>Continue</b>, and then selecting <b>Authorize</b>. This will allow <i>bleed</i> to enter your server and will grant it's corresponding bot role the <b>Administrator</b> permission to fully operate. If neither the <b>Administrator</b> nor the <b>Manage Messages</b> permissions are granted, then <i>bleed</i> will prompt you with a warning to grant one of those permissions when attempting to run a command.</div>

                            <p class="accordion">How can I have faith that bleed will not nuke my server?</p>
                            <div class="panel"><i>bleed</i> is a <u>verified</u> Discord bot. If <i>bleed</i> was to nuke your server, then the bot and its creator <b><a href="https://jace.lol/discord" target="_blank">jace#0819</a></b> would be banished from the <b>Discord</b> platform. This is <i>not</i> a desirable outcome.</div> <!-- If this is a serious concern that you have, please feel free to exit this page by pressing the <b>ALT + F4</b> keys on your keyboard, shutting down your computer, and then unplugging your router. -->

                            <p class="accordion">Where can I receive help if I'm confused or have any questions?</p>

                            <p class="accordion">How can I obtain donor perks (ex: ,lastfm mode)?</p>
