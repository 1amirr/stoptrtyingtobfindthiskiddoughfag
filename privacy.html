  <h1>Why do you need the data and how is it used?</h1>
  <p>when a command is invoked, we store that message content for a maximum of 14 days for debugging purposes. we also store deleted & edited message content for a maximum of 24 hours and is usually overwritten immediately as we only store the latest entry for the "snipe" and "editsnipe" commands.</p>
  <p>guild ids, channel ids, role ids, user ids and message ids are all stored for our system to figure out what [something here] belongs to or when our functions require that data</p>
  <p>nickname and username changes are logged in order for the "namehistory" command to function. users can clear this data themselves at any time.</p>
  <h1>Who is your collected information shared with?</h1>
  <p>We do not sell and expose your information to others/third parties by any means.</p>
